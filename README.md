# Crypto_Clustering
The code ive've written normalizes cryptocurrency data using StandardScaler, creates a scaled DataFrame, and then applies the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-Means clustering. 

After identifying the best k, I performed clustering on both the original scaled data and a reduced version of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

The code also includes generating scatter plots to visualize the clustering results, with cryptocurrency IDs displayed on hover. Finally, I've compared the effectiveness of clustering using the original features versus the reduced features obtained through PCA.
